# ImageCompression

Big enterprises and organisations store a vast amount of images. The current technologies of image compression use similar characteristics within an image to compress the image. Deep Auto encoder neural network trains on a large set of images to figure out similarities between the images in the set. The network then uses those similarities to compress them and represent them using fewer codes than usually possible from current compression techniques.

"compress.io" that's what we call it.


This project is part of my research at SKNCOE,Pune during the training internship in ML/AI,for which i was awarded the best intern award.
